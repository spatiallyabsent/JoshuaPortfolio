              My name is Joshua Dow and currently I'm located in El Paso Texas. I am currently working hard to become a web developer,
              before that I worked in the textile industry and managed multiple drycleaning and laundromat facilities including
              one in Fort Bliss for over 10 years. I have a bacholors in English and American Literature from UTEP and have passed the DSHS National Registry 
              Assessment Exam to work as an emt here in Texas. I believe in a lifestyle of learning and self improvement no matter where you are in life.
              Some of my hobbies and intersts outside of work include anything related to virtual reality but especialy the social applications
              this technology can create for people who are immobile or otherwise unable to leave their home or care facility.
              I also enjoy painting and creating miniature diahramas geared towards science fiction or fantasy. <!--add intro, background, skill, passion, goals/motivation, work philosophy, few sentences on hobbies or something-->
